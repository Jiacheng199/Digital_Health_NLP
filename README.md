# Digital Health
#### DI-RedBack
# Project Overview
The project aims to set up and customise a tool and design a platform that will allow a human-in-the-loop to manually review the mapping results (between short free-text strings provided by clinical practitioners and SNOMED CT),
make corrections, and feed these back to re-train the system. This tool will be deployed using Docker inside an existing virtual machine.

# Background
Analysis of clinical documentation is critical for many digital health projects but extracting information from free-text clinical notes can be difficult. Typically, the rationale for prescribing a particular medication – the reason for prescription – is commonly provided by clinical practitioners in short free-text strings. We are interested in normalising those short strings by mapping them onto a knowledge base of canonical clinical terms, known as SNOMED CT (https://www.snomed.org/).
