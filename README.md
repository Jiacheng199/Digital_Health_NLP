# Development for sprint2(future sptrint3 possible)

This branch is for developing mapping data modification and login/register pages for now(US05 and US08).

This branch will be merged into the milestone branch using either the merge or manual copy method.

## How to run the project
Since we need to load the mock data to perform the mapping data modification testing, so one way to testing the current branch is to run 
python code: `python -m http.server`; This will allow you to run the project on localhost:8000.

## NOTE
This sprint is only a front-end project, but able to get the data from input. logical operation should not be implemented in this sprint branch,.
